## TENSEGRITY STRUCTURE

I designed a functional tensegrity structure in CAD software with precise dimensioning to ensure stability and accuracy. The model was then prepared for fabrication by exporting the STL files and slicing them using **Creality software**, where print parameters such as infill, layer height, and supports were optimized. Using a Creality 3D printer, I successfully printed both the parts in PLA material. After printing, the components were cleaned, finished, and assembled with fishing line strings to achieve the floating effect of the tensegrity structure. The final assembly was tested for balance and strength to ensure proper load distribution.

### Real World Applications
 
 Compliant Tweezers:

Biomedical & Micro-manipulation → Used for handling delicate biological samples, cells, and tissues without causing damage.

Electronics assembly → Useful in picking and placing tiny components on PCBs where high precision is required.

Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) → Act as micro-grippers in microrobotics for precise assembly tasks.

Everyday use → Adapted into cosmetic tweezers, medical forceps, and laboratory gripping tools.

 Ortho-planar Spring Structure:

Vibration isolation → Provides controlled out-of-plane flexibility, making it useful in aerospace and automotive systems.

Precision instruments → Used in compliant joints for sensors, actuators, and optical devices where frictionless, repeatable motion is needed.

Medical devices → Incorporated in surgical tools and implants requiring flexible, fatigue-resistant motion.

Fabrication Plan:
The designs were modeled in CAD, exported as STL files, and sliced for 3D printing using PLA for prototypes. Post-processing included support removal and surface finishing, followed by assembly and testing for functional performance.

## XFOIL DIRECT ANALYSIS
I performed aerodynamic analysis on three different airfoils to identify the most suitable one for a Horizontal Take-Off and Landing (HTOL) aircraft. Using XFLR5/XFOIL, I compared their lift, drag, and moment characteristics at multiple Reynolds numbers. The study included evaluating drag polars, lift-to-drag ratios, and stall behavior to assess overall performance.Based on the results, the airfoil with the highest efficiency and smoother stall characteristics was selected as the best option for HTOL application.
