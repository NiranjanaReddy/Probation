## TENSEGRITY STRUCTURE

I designed a functional tensegrity structure in CAD software with precise dimensioning to ensure stability and accuracy. The model was then prepared for fabrication by exporting the STL files and slicing them using **Creality software**, where print parameters such as infill, layer height, and supports were optimized. Using a Creality 3D printer, I successfully printed both the parts in PLA material. After printing, the components were cleaned, finished, and assembled with fishing line strings to achieve the floating effect of the tensegrity structure. The final assembly was tested for balance and strength to ensure proper load distribution.

## XFOIL DIRECT ANALYSIS
I performed aerodynamic analysis on three different airfoils to identify the most suitable one for a Horizontal Take-Off and Landing (HTOL) aircraft. Using XFLR5/XFOIL, I compared their lift, drag, and moment characteristics at multiple Reynolds numbers. The study included evaluating drag polars, lift-to-drag ratios, and stall behavior to assess overall performance.Based on the results, the airfoil with the highest efficiency and smoother stall characteristics was selected as the best option for HTOL application.
